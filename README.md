## Data Analysis using Snowflake

### **Customer Spending Insights Query**

**Query Output Table:**

| AMOUNT_RANGE | NUM_CUSTOMERS |
|--------------|---------------|
| 50‚Äì100       | 10            |
| 101‚Äì200      | 18            |
| 201‚Äì300      | 24            |
| 301‚Äì400      | 18            |
| 401‚Äì500      | 21            |

#### üîç Analysis:

- The highest concentration of customers (24) falls within the $201‚Äì$300 range.
- High-value customers (spending $401‚Äì$500) account for **24% of total customers**, indicating a strong upper-tier.
- Customers spending below $200 represent only 28 individuals, a smaller and lower-yielding segment.

#### üíº Business Implications:

- **High-value segmentation**: Launch exclusive campaigns targeting the 21 top spenders with premium incentives or loyalty programs.
- **Upselling Opportunity**: Customers in the $201‚Äì$300 range could be incentivized to move up tiers via bundled offers or cashback campaigns.
- **ROI-Driven Marketing**: Targeted marketing towards high-LTV segments improves acquisition cost efficiency and overall customer retention.

### **Fraud Prediction Count Query**

**Query Output Table:**

| FRAUD_RISK_SCORE | COUNT_OF_TRANSACTIONS |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| 0                | 150                   |
| 1                | 45                    |
| 2                | 20                    |
| 3                | 5                     |

#### üîç Analysis:

- **68%** of transactions are low-risk (score 0), while **11.4%** fall into high-risk brackets (score 2‚Äì3).
- Score 3 transactions, although rare (5 total), require **immediate attention** for fraud prevention.
- Score 1 transactions (45) are low priority but still warrant trend monitoring.

#### üíº Business Implications:

- **Operational Efficiency**: Focus human review on just 25 high-risk transactions out of 220‚Äîmaximizing fraud prevention efforts while reducing false positives.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Implement dynamic dashboards that alert fraud teams of any sudden increase in Score 2‚Äì3 activity.
- **Cost Control**: Automate low-risk transactions (Score 0) to reduce overhead from unnecessary manual checks.

### **Transaction Type and Amount Query**

![Transaction Type and Amount Query](https://github.com/lewis-hue/Fraud-Detection-Financial-Transaction-Analysis-Snowflake-/blob/main/Staging%20the%20Raw%20Transaction%20Data.png)

**Query Output Table:**

| TRANSACTION_TYPE | TOTAL_AMOUNT |
|------------------|--------------|
| Purchase         | $150,000     |
| Refund           | $20,000      |
| Exchange         | $5,000       |

#### üîç Analysis:

- Purchases account for **85.7%** of transaction volume, indicating strong sales conversion.
- Refunds and exchanges contribute to **14.3%**, which may point to **product dissatisfaction** or **policy abuse**.

#### üíº Business Implications:

- **Revenue Protection**: High refunds ($20,000) suggest reviewing return policies and product QA for recurring issues.
- **Customer Experience Strategy**: Analyze exchange data by product/merchant to improve satisfaction and reduce costly reversals.
- **Margin Optimization**: Reducing refunds/exchanges to under 10% could recover an estimated **$7,500** in potential revenue.
